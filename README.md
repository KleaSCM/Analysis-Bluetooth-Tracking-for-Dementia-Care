Can Bluetooth Tracking Revolutionize Dementia Care?

Inspired by a post from Avon and Somerset Police about the launch of Tile devices as part of their award-winning Dementia Safeguarding Scheme, I conducted an analysis to explore their real-world effectiveness. The concept is promising: leveraging a network of 76 million smartphones via Life360 to help locate individuals with dementia.

What I Discovered: Using mathematical models, I evaluated the detection probability of Tile devices based on factors such as:

Population density

Tile adoption rates

Bluetooth range limitations

Wandering areas for individuals with dementia


Here are the results:

In urban areas, detection probability can reach ~78%, primarily due to higher smartphone density and Tile adoption rates.

In rural areas, detection probability drops to less than 1%, highlighting a critical limitation of Bluetooth-based solutions in low-density regions.

Even with a global network, the effectiveness is constrained by adoption rates and the relatively short range of Bluetooth compared to GPS.


Key Takeaways:

The technology shows promise in urban settings, but rural areas remain underserved due to population density and adoption challenges.

Bluetooth solutions might work best when combined with complementary systems like GPS for enhanced coverage.


Looking Forward: This initiative by Avon and Somerset Police is a step in the right direction, but bridging the gap between technology and real-world impact will require innovation, investment, and collaboration. Could integrating AI, machine learning, or GPS help scale these solutions effectively?
